## Getting started

### Requirements

node.js >= 10.13 is required. Make sure you have a compatible version running `node -v` command in your terminal.

If you have to install node, you might be interested in using _nvm_ to install and switch easily between any node version.

### Installation

1. Download and execute Gatsby to create our blog:

```bash
$ npx gatsby new fireblog https://github.com/fireblogcms/gatsby-starter-fireblog
$ cd fireblog
```

2. Create a `.env` file and fill the variables from `.env.template` file.

- GATSBY_SITE_URL : the absolute URL of your site. For localhost, it will be "http://localhost:8000"
- GATSBY_FIREBLOG_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT : url of your fireblog API. If not specified, a demo blog will be used so that you can try fireblog without creating an account.
- GATSBY_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_TRACKING_ID : enable google analytics stats.

Running the dev server:

```bash
$ npm run develop
```

Build and serve the production files:

```bash
$ npm run build && npm run serve
```

## Customize for your brand

- Put your own logo to `static/images/logo.png`
- Edit `$primary` color from `src/scss/_variables.scss`. Feel free to customize any variables here !
- Customize css theme by editing `src/scss/_theme.scss`
- Configure top menu links, Progressive Web App name, and more by editing `./gatsby-config.js` file.
